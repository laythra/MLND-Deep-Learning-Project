# MLND-Deep-Learning-Project
In this project, i built a deep CNN to recognize dog breeds and classifies each picture it receivedog to its breed,
or even if it recieves a picture of a human it would map it to its closet similar dog breed that looks like it.

Techniques used:

Deep Learning
Transfer Learning
